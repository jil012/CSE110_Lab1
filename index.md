## Brief Bio:
I am from Shanghai, China. I am a fourth year in Math-CS major, and I am interested in Machine Learning, reinforcement learning more specifically. My favorite TV show is _The Game of Thrones_; the most memorable scene is the Battle of Castle Black; and, the most favorite quote is the oath of the Night's Watch.
> "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."

I knew little about programming before I entered the college. The reason for me to become a CS major is the video [Multi-Agent Hide and Seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY) from OpenAI, and I was very impressed by the abilities of the agents.
